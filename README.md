# Greetings, I'm Bardia!

## About Me
I recently completed my BSc in Computer Engineering at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My technical skills include proficiency in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, R, C/C++, SQL, Docker, and Kubernetes. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and developing practical, impactful software.

## Course Archive
As part of my academic journey, I've compiled an archive of course materials from the Computer Engineering Department. This archive contains over 100 repositories, providing valuable resources for students and enthusiasts alike. The repositories cover a range of topics and are open for contributions. If you find them useful or have improvements, please feel free to contribute!
